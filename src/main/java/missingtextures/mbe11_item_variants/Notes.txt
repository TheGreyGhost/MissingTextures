MBE11_ITEM_VARIANTS

This example is an Item with variants, illustrating two different ways of changing the rendering to suit the variant.
The bottle has two types of information, both stored in the metadata / damage of the ItemStack:
Bottle contents (LIME, LEMON, CHERRY, ORANGE)
Bottle fullness (EMPTY, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

It will show you
1) how to create an Item class with different variants and how to register them
2) how to control which variants are displayed on the creative tabs
3) how to control which rendering model is used for each variant
4) how to change the item description for each variant
5) how to use multiple layer rendering to change the appearance depending on the variant

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
Startup
ItemVariants
resources\assets\missingtextures\lang\en_US.lang - for the displayed name of the item variants
resources\assets\missingtextures\models\item\mbe11_item_variants_xxx - for the models used to render the item variants
resources\assets\missingtextures\textures\items\mbe11_item_variants_layerx_xxx.png - textures used for the item rendering
  in layer 0 and layer 1

The item will appear in the Miscellaneous tab in the creative inventory.

Common errors:
"Missing Model", "Missing texture", etc:
These are caused when you have specified a filename or path which is not correct, typically:
1) you've misspelled it
2) the upper/lower case doesn't match
3) you've forgotten the resource domain, eg "blockmodel" instead of "missingtextures:blockmodel"
4) the folder structure of your assets folders is incorrect
5) If using IntelliJ 14 - the assets isn't be copied to the right place, you need to apply a fix to your build.gradle,
  see here http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php/topic,21354.0.html
6) You haven't properly registered with the ModelBakery and/or the ItemModelMesher
